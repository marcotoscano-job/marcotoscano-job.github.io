Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm  Marco Toscano. 

I am a Cyber Security Analyst with over five years of hands-on experience in protecting organisations from cyber threats. My passion for technology and dedication to ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information has driven my successful career in the dynamic field of cybersecurity.

I hold a Computer engineer master degree and bring over 5 years of hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating cyber threats. My expertise extends across a spectrum of security domains, including threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability management. I thrive on staying ahead of the curve, constantly updating my knowledge to counter emerging cyber threats effectively.

In addition to technical proficiency, I place a strong emphasis on effective communication and collaboration. I understand the importance of conveying complex technical information in a clear and accessible manner, both to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I bring a proactive and strategic approach to enhancing organizational cybersecurity posture.

My hobby
======

I am passionate about Astronomy, Bouldering, Cryptocurrency, CTF, fantasy books and Sci-Fi movies.


My history
======

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just read [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(novel)) and it will answer **all** your questions.
